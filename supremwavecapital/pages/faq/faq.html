                    <h2>WHAT IS BITCOIN</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoin is a form of digital currency which is based on an open source code that
                    was created and is held electronically. Bitcoin is a decentralized form of currency, 
                    meaning that it does not belong to any form of government and is not controlled by anyone.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="col">
                    <h2>WHO DEVELOPED BITCOIN?</h2>
                    <p>The original Bitcoin code was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto under MIT open source credentials. 
                        In 2008 Nakamoto outlined the idea behind Bitcoin in his White Paper, which scientifically 
                        described how the cryptocurrency would function. Bitcoin is the first successful digital 
                        currency designed with trust in cryptography over central authorities. Satoshi left the Bitcoin 
                        code in the hands of developers and the community in 2010. Thus far hundreds of developers have
                         added to the core code throughout the years.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h2>WHAT IS BITCOIN MINING</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoin mining is analogous to the mining of gold, but its digital form. The process involves specialized
                         computers solving algorithmic equations or hash functions. These problems help miners to confirm blocks 
                         of transactions held within the network. Bitcoin mining provides a reward for miners by paying out in Bitcoin
                          in turn the miners confirm transactions on the blockchain. Miners introduce new Bitcoin into the network and
                           also secure the system with transaction confirmation. They are also rewarded network fees for when they harvest
                            new coin and a time when the last bitcoin is found mining will continue.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h2>IS BITCOIN USED FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITES?</h2>
                    <p>This is a yet another controversial topic. Because of the freedom and the degree of anonymity that the use of Bitcoin
                         offers, many users who were seeking to purchase or solicit illegal goods or services initially turned to the use of
                          Bitcoin as a method of payment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h2>CAN BITCOIN BE REGULATED IN ANY WAY?</h2>
                    <p>Again, when a user decides to use a specific type of software for their Bitcoin wallet, they are deciding what direction
                     the Bitcoin network is heading towards. In other words, you need the cooperation of nearly every single user in order to
                     modify any aspect of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h2>IS BITCOIN ANONYMOUSE?</h2>
                    <p>Participants in Bitcoin transactions are identified by public addresses – those are the long strings of around 30 characters
                     you see in a person’s Bitcoin address, usually starting with the numerals ‘1’ or ‘3’. For every transaction, the sending and 
                     receiving addresses are publicly-viewable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h2>HOW CAN I SELL BITCOINS?</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoins can be sold locally using LocalBitcoins, on Bitcoin brokerages / exchanges, using two-way Bitcoin Teller Machines (BTM’s) 
                    or you can pay for a good or service with them. Bitcoins can be sold to just about anyone as long as they have a Bitcoin address, and
                    can be sold for any fiat currency in the world or traded for a physical good. Feel free to check out our recommended list of exchanges
                    and brokerage services to sell your bitcoins online.</p>
